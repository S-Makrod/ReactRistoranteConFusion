# ReactRistoranteConFusion

## Necessary Software

I used visual studio code to make this website but any editor should work. If you download the files you will need the node modules to run the site. So navigate to the directory of where you saved the confusion folder and install the dependencies. 

When you are in the confusion folder run 

<pre>yarn install</pre>

Then navigate to the json-server and run  

<pre>npm install --force</pre>

To start the project you will need two terminals. In the first terminal navigate to the json-server folder and run

<pre>json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000</pre>

Then in the second terminal navigate to the confusion folder and run

<pre>yarn start</pre>

## Demo
